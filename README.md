# Crypto currency app
An application that shows most used crypto currencies and their value through time.

* The application is Build using mainly **React** and **Javascript** with modern practices like hooks, functional components, arrow functions.
* I used also React routers, **Axios** and fetched data from the great @**CoinGecko**.
* Charts where done using **Chartjs** and **Boostrap** for the design.
