# Crypto currency app :smiley: ðŸŽ‰ ðŸ¦„ :white_check_mark: :moneybag:
A web application that shows most used crypto currencies and their value through time.

* The application is Build using mainly **React** and **Javascript** with modern practices like hooks, functional components and arrow functions.
* I used also React routers and **Axios** to fetch data from **CoinGecko** API.
* Charts where done using **Chartjs** and **Boostrap** for the design.
* Charts are available per day, week and year to see the change of the currency.
* Current value is shown at the top left of the chart followed by percent change for that day.
* Other valuable information like market cap, total supply, lowest and highest value for that day are also displayed below the chart.
* The user can add currencies from the one available in the dropmenu.
